# Soccer-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL
Provide data analysis using SQL language and SQLite

Database Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer?resource=download

## Database Description: 
- An ultimate European Soccer Database with 25,000 matches
- 10,000 players
- 11 European Countries with their lead championships
- seasons 2008 to 2106
- Players and Teams' attributes* sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates
- Team line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates)
- Betting odds from up to 10 providers
- Detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etcâ€¦) for +10,000 matches

## Motivation:
As an enthuasitic soccer fans and a data science student, I am deeply interested in this dataset and want to consolidate my knowledge of using SQL languages to write queries that would pull data from the database, manipulate it, sort it and extract it. 

## Lessons:
- understand the basic structure of the query
- understand the concept of Keys (for joining tables)
- write basic queries in correct orders (see Notes in the code)
- group data to different levels
- use subqueries
